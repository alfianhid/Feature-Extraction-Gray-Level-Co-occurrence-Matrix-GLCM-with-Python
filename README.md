# Feature Extraction: Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with Python

Gray-Level Co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is a texture analysis method in digital image processing. This method represents the relationship between two neighboring pixels that have gray intensity, distance, and angle. In general, we use GLCM to get texture features in images such as dissimilarity, correlation, homogeneity, contrast, and others.

This repository contains scripts or source code on how to perform feature extraction on images that have been converted into grayscale images so that we can utilize the extraction results for various needs such as correlation analysis between features, features in classification, and others.
